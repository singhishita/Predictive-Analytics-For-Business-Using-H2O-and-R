# Predictive-Analytics-For-Business-Using-H2O-and-R

This is a project-based course provided by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/predictive-analytics-business-h2o-r/home/welcome). 

## Components:-
1. Apply machine learning and predictive analytics to solve a business problem
2. Explain and describe automatic machine learning, i.e, [AutoML](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html).
3. Perform Automatic Machine Learning with H2O and R

H2O is a leading open-source machine learning and artificial intelligence platform trusted by data scientists and machine learning practitioners. It has APIs available in R, Python, Scala, and also a web-based point and click interface called Flow. H2O's AutoML automates the process of training and tuning a large selection of models, allowing the user to focus on other aspects of the data science and machine learning pipelines such as data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model deployment.
